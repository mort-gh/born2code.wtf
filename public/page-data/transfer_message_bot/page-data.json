If the number of likes is equal to COUNT value or more than half the number of subscribers, the message becomes popular and gets queued for publication in another chat. Popular posts are published no more than once per time in QUEUE_INTERVAL. Using the bot, you can track which messages most popular in the community to repost them into another chat.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/54b221ce4cb0cbea84b4dabc67b5f39b/channel-demo.gif\" alt=\"BabyNamePicker\"></p>\n<p><em>This is a private repository.
